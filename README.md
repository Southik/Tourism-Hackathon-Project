When working on your task FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

Step-by-Step Workflow

1) Pull Before Starting Any Work
    - Always start your session by pulling the latest changes from the main branch. This ensures youâ€™re working on the most up-to-date version of the code and minimizes conflicts.
    - In GitHub Desktop, click Fetch origin and then Pull to get any new changes from the remote repository.

2) Create a New Branch for Your Work
    - Instead of working directly on the main branch, create a new branch for each feature or fix you're working on.
    - To create a branch in GitHub Desktop, go to Current Branch > New Branch. Name the branch based on the feature or fix, like feature-login or bugfix-authentication.
    
3) Work on Your Branch and Commit Changes
    - Make changes on your branch, and commit them incrementally. This makes it easier to track progress and revert specific changes if needed.
    - Click Commit to [branch name] after each meaningful update.
  
4) Pull Changes From Main Again Before Merging
    - Before merging your branch back into the main branch, switch to the main branch and pull the latest changes.
    - Then, switch back to your feature branch and merge the latest main branch changes into your branch (in GitHub Desktop, go to Branch > Merge into Current Branch...).
    - Resolve any conflicts that come up. This step ensures that your branch is fully compatible with the latest main branch changes before merging.

5) Create a Pull Request (PR)
    - When your work is complete and all conflicts are resolved, create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch. This can be done in GitHub Desktop by clicking Create Pull Request, which will open the GitHub web interface to finalize the PR.
    - Reviewers can review the changes in the PR and suggest any additional modifications.
  
6) Merge the PR and Pull the Changes Locally
    - Once the PR is approved, merge it into the main branch (typically done on GitHub, not GitHub Desktop).
    - After merging, switch to the main branch in GitHub Desktop and pull the latest changes to sync your local main branch with the remote repository.
